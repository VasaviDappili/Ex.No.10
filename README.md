# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:21-05-2025
## Reg. No: 212223040030

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

# Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
    ○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
    ○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
    ○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format 
      the answer.
    ○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
    ○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
    ○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
    ○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
    ○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
    ○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
    ○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
    ○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
    ○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
    ○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the 
      model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic 
      filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments
6.	○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
    ○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, 
    or actions.
7.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
    ○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
    ○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
    ○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
    ○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

##cTest Case 1: Business Report on Market Trends
### Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt:
Write a business report on current market trends.

### Output:
A general overview covering inflation impact, consumer behavior changes, and post-pandemic recovery in sectors like e-commerce, tech, and real estate.

### Prompt 2 – With Query Decomposition & Fact Checklist:
Write a business report on market trends. Break it into key segments: (1) Emerging industries, (2) Consumer behavior shifts, and (3) Global economic influences. Include recent data and market statistics.

### Output:
A structured business report identifying AI, green energy, and remote work tech as emerging sectors; citing 2025 consumer surveys on digital purchases; and referencing economic forecasts from IMF and World Bank.

### Prompt 3 – With Semantic Filtering:
Write a formal business report on 2025 market trends intended for corporate executives. Use professional tone, bullet points, and industry-specific language.

### Output:
Polished report with corporate tone, listing trends like AI adoption, inflation-resistant investments, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) mandates. Includes visual formatting suggestions for boardroom presentation.

## Test Case 2: Educational Report on Renewable Energy

### Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt:
Write a report on renewable energy.

### Output:
A general explanation covering types of renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), their benefits over fossil fuels, and environmental advantages.

### Prompt 2 – With Decision-Making and Tail Generation:
Choose one of the following focuses for a renewable energy report: (a) Solar energy adoption in rural areas, (b) Offshore wind farms, (c) Innovations in bioenergy. Then write a detailed section about how it impacts energy sustainability and future development.

### Output:
A focused report on offshore wind farms, explaining their energy output capacity, environmental impact, and future investment potential. Includes analysis of global trends and policy recommendations.

### Prompt 3 – With Semantic Filter and Answer Engineering:
Write an educational report on renewable energy aimed at high school students. Use a clear and friendly tone, short paragraphs, and relatable real-world examples. Include a summary at the end.

### Output:
Engaging, easy-to-read report that explains how solar panels work using school rooftop examples, and how wind turbines help power towns. Ends with a student-friendly summary encouraging clean energy awareness.
