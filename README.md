## Date:21-05-2025
## Reg. No: 212223040030

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.


### **Procedure:**

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns**

   * **Query Decomposition**: Breaking complex queries into simpler components.
   * **Decision Making**: Presenting options and guiding the AI to choose.
   * **Answer Engineering**: Structuring the answer with specific formatting.
   * **Fact Check List**: Ensuring factual correctness.
   * **Tail Generation**: Extending narratives logically.
   * **Menu Actions**: Offering multiple paths or content styles.
   * **Semantic Filtering**: Controlling tone and style of output.

2. **Choosing the Content Types:**

   * **Test Case 1**: Article on Climate Change
   * **Test Case 2**: Creative Writing - Sci-Fi Short Story

3. **Creating the Prompts:**

   * Start with simple base prompts.
   * Iteratively add complexity using the above techniques.

4. **Generating and Refining Outputs:**

   * Analyze AI outputs.
   * Refine based on coherence, creativity, and tone.
   * Test different prompt variations.

5. **Review and Evaluation:**

   * Evaluate output versions for accuracy, originality, tone, and structure.

## Test Case 1: Business Report on Market Trends
### Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt:
Write a business report on current market trends.

### Output:
A general overview covering inflation impact, consumer behavior changes, and post-pandemic recovery in sectors like e-commerce, tech, and real estate.

### Prompt 2 – With Query Decomposition & Fact Checklist:
Write a business report on market trends. Break it into key segments: (1) Emerging industries, (2) Consumer behavior shifts, and (3) Global economic influences. Include recent data and market statistics.

### Output:
A structured business report identifying AI, green energy, and remote work tech as emerging sectors; citing 2025 consumer surveys on digital purchases; and referencing economic forecasts from IMF and World Bank.

### Prompt 3 – With Semantic Filtering:
Write a formal business report on 2025 market trends intended for corporate executives. Use professional tone, bullet points, and industry-specific language.

### Output:
Polished report with corporate tone, listing trends like AI adoption, inflation-resistant investments, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) mandates. Includes visual formatting suggestions for boardroom presentation.

## Test Case 2: Educational Report on Renewable Energy

### Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt:
Write a report on renewable energy.

### Output:
A general explanation covering types of renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), their benefits over fossil fuels, and environmental advantages.

### Prompt 2 – With Decision-Making and Tail Generation:
Choose one of the following focuses for a renewable energy report: (a) Solar energy adoption in rural areas, (b) Offshore wind farms, (c) Innovations in bioenergy. Then write a detailed section about how it impacts energy sustainability and future development.

### Output:
A focused report on offshore wind farms, explaining their energy output capacity, environmental impact, and future investment potential. Includes analysis of global trends and policy recommendations.

### Prompt 3 – With Semantic Filter and Answer Engineering:
Write an educational report on renewable energy aimed at high school students. Use a clear and friendly tone, short paragraphs, and relatable real-world examples. Include a summary at the end.

### Output:
Engaging, easy-to-read report that explains how solar panels work using school rooftop examples, and how wind turbines help power towns. Ends with a student-friendly summary encouraging clean energy awareness.
